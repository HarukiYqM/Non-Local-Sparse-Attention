We provide scripts for reproducing all the results from our paper. You can train your own model from scratch, or use pre-trained model to enlarge your images.

**Differences between Torch version**
* Codes are much more compact. (Removed all unnecessary parts.)
* Models are smaller. (About half.)
* Slightly better performances.
* Training and evaluation requires less memory.
* Python-based.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.6
* PyTorch >= 0.4.0
* numpy
* skimage
* **imageio**
* matplotlib
* tqdm

**Recent updates**

* July 22, 2018
  * Thanks for recent commits that contains RDN and RCAN. Please see ``code/demo.sh`` to train/test those models.
  * Now the dataloader is much stable than the previous version. Please erase ``DIV2K/bin`` folder that is created before this commit. Also, please avoid to use ``--ext bin`` argument. Our code will automatically pre-decode png images before training. If you do not have enough spaces(~10GB) in your disk, we recommend ``--ext img``(But SLOW!).


## Code
Clone this repository into any place you want.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thstkdgus35/EDSR-PyTorch
cd EDSR-PyTorch
```

## Quick start (Demo)
You can test our super-resolution algorithm with your own images. Place your images in ``test`` folder. (like ``test/<your_image>``) We support **png** and **jpeg** files.

Run the script in ``src`` folder. Before you run the demo, please uncomment the appropriate line in ```demo.sh``` that you want to execute.
```bash
cd src       # You are now in */EDSR-PyTorch/src
sh demo.sh
```

You can find the result images from ```experiment/test/results``` folder.

*Baseline models are in ``experiment/model``. Please download our final models from [here](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/model_pytorch.tar) (542MB)
**We measured PSNR using DIV2K 0801 ~ 0900, RGB channels, without self-ensemble. (scale + 2) pixels from the image boundary are ignored.

You can evaluate your models with widely-used benchmark datasets:

[Set5 - Bevilacqua et al. BMVC 2012](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Aline.Roumy/results/SR_BMVC12.html),

[Set14 - Zeyde et al. LNCS 2010](https://sites.google.com/site/romanzeyde/research-interests),

[B100 - Martin et al. ICCV 2001](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/),

[Urban100 - Huang et al. CVPR 2015](https://sites.google.com/site/jbhuang0604/publications/struct_sr).

For these datasets, we first convert the result images to YCbCr color space and evaluate PSNR on the Y channel only. You can download [benchmark datasets](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/benchmark.tar) (250MB). Set ``--dir_data <where_benchmark_folder_located>`` to evaluate the EDSR and MDSR with the benchmarks.

## How to train EDSR and MDSR
We used [DIV2K](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/%7Etimofter/publications/Agustsson-CVPRW-2017.pdf) dataset to train our model. Please download it from [here](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/research/EDSR/DIV2K.tar) (7.1GB).

Unpack the tar file to any place you want. Then, change the ```dir_data``` argument in ```src/option.py``` to the place where DIV2K images are located.

We recommend you to pre-process the images before training. This step will decode all **png** files and save them as binaries. Use ``--ext sep_reset`` argument on your first run. You can skip the decoding part and use saved binaries with ``--ext sep`` argument.

If you have enough RAM (>= 32GB), you can use ``--ext bin`` argument to pack all DIV2K images in one binary file.

You can train EDSR and MDSR by yourself. All scripts are provided in the ``src/demo.sh``. Note that EDSR (x3, x4) requires pre-trained EDSR (x2). You can ignore this constraint by removing ```--pre_train <x2 model>``` argument.

```bash
cd src       # You are now in */EDSR-PyTorch/src
sh demo.sh
```

**Update log**
* Jan 04, 2018
  * Many parts are re-written. You cannot use previous scripts and models directly.
  * Pre-trained MDSR is temporarily disabled.
  * Training details are included.

* Jan 09, 2018
  * Missing files are included (```src/data/MyImage.py```).
  * Some links are fixed.

* Jan 16, 2018
  * Memory efficient forward function is implemented.
  * Add --chop_forward argument to your script to enable it.
  * Basically, this function first split a large image to small patches. Those images are merged after super-resolution. I checked this function with 12GB memory, 4000 x 2000 input image in scale 4. (Therefore, the output will be 16000 x 8000.)

* Feb 21, 2018
  * Fixed the problem when loading pre-trained multi-gpu model.
  * Added pre-trained scale 2 baseline model.
  * This code now only saves the best-performing model by default. For MDSR, 'the best' can be ambiguous. Use --save_models argument to save all the intermediate models.
  * PyTorch 0.3.1 changed their implementation of DataLoader function. Therefore, I also changed my implementation of MSDataLoader. You can find it on feature/dataloader branch.

* Feb 23, 2018
  * Now PyTorch 0.3.1 is default. Use legacy/0.3.0 branch if you use the old version.
   
  * With a new ``src/data/DIV2K.py`` code, one can easily create new data class for super-resolution.
  * New binary data pack. (Please remove the ``DIV2K_decoded`` folder from your dataset if you have.)
  * With ``--ext bin``, this code will automatically generates and saves the binary data pack that corresponds to previous ``DIV2K_decoded``. (This requires huge RAM (~45GB, Swap can be used.), so please be careful.)
  * If you cannot make the binary pack, just use the default setting (``--ext img``).

  * Fixed a bug that PSNR in the log and PSNR calculated from the saved images does not match.
  * Now saved images have better quality! (PSNR is ~0.1dB higher than the original code.)
  * Added performance comparison between Torch7 model and PyTorch models.

* Mar 5, 2018
  * All baseline models are uploaded.
  * Now supports half-precision at test time. Use ``--precision half``  to enable it. This does not degrade the output images.

* Mar 11, 2018
  * Fixed some typos in the code and script.
  * Now --ext img is default setting. Although we recommend you to use --ext bin when training, please use --ext img when you use --test_only.
  * Skip_batch operation is implemented. Use --skip_threshold argument to skip the batch that you want to ignore. Although this function is not exactly same with that of Torch7 version, it will work as you expected.

* Mar 20, 2018
  * Use ``--ext sep_reset`` to pre-decode large png files. Those decoded files will be saved to the same directory with DIV2K png files. After the first run, you can use ``--ext sep`` to save time.
  * Now supports various benchmark datasets. For example, try ``--data_test Set5`` to test your model on the Set5 images.
  * Changed the behavior of skip_batch.

* Mar 29, 2018
  * We now provide all models from our paper.
  * We also provide ``MDSR_baseline_jpeg`` model that suppresses JPEG artifacts in original low-resolution image. Please use it if you have any trouble.
  * ``MyImage`` dataset is changed to ``Demo`` dataset. Also, it works more efficient than before.
  * Some codes and script are re-written.

* Apr 9, 2018
  * VGG and Adversarial loss is implemented based on [SRGAN](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Ledig_Photo-Realistic_Single_Image_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf). [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) and [gradient penalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028) are also implemented, but they are not tested yet.
  * Many codes are refactored. If there exists a bug, please report it.
  * [D-DBPN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02735) is implemented. Default setting is D-DBPN-L.

* Apr 26, 2018
  * Compatible with PyTorch 0.4.0
  * Please use the legacy/0.3.1 branch if you are using the old version of PyTorch.
  * Minor bug fixes
